  How it works
  ------------
  The first thing you need to do is create a user, if an invalid email is used the app won't allow it. Afterwards with that email and password you log in, there is a verification with the database and if the information is correct you can continue, not otherwise. In the next screen you'll see the map of the zones with the respective colors. Finally if you click in a zone, information regarding the fullness of that zone will appear.
  
  Function Requirement

  In order to compile and use the app the user must create an Google Maps API Key and replace it on the google_maps_api.xml located on   the Values Folder.
